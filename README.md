<h1>Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning Course â€“ Neural Networks with TensorFlow 2 by Cluster TIC Galicia</h1>
This Deep Learning course covers both fundamental and advanced concepts for developing and training neural network models using Python. 
It starts with the creation of artificial neural networks (ANN), progresses to convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image processing, and then explores recurrent neural networks (RNN) for working with sequential data like time-series forecasting. 
The course also includes applications of unsupervised learning, such as clustering and anomaly detection, providing a comprehensive understanding of techniques used in modern artificial intelligence.<br><br>
In this repository, you will find Jupyter notebooks with practical exercises corresponding to each course topic, including image classification with CNN, time-series forecasting with RNN, and unsupervised learning applications. 
Additionally, it contains datasets used in the projects, pre-trained models, and installation files to set up the necessary environment and dependencies to run the code.
